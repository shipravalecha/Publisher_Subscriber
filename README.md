Pub/Sub Bellman ford algorithm

Implemented publisher subscriber model to detect the arbritrage opportunities in the forex trade market using Bellman ford algorithm.
This system takes the published quotes of transactions and reads them to identify the negative cycle in the forex transactions. 

The solution was built in python3 by subscribing to live stock market data and using Bellman Ford Negative cycle detection algorithm to 
expose any arbitrage in the transactions graph.
